                                        <h2>Домашнее задание №4</h2>
                                        One of the first things I do when I arrive at work is set up my station. <br>
                                        This includes getting my notepad and pen ready, and making sure my uniform is
                                        clean and presentable. <br> I also speak with the kitchen staff to see if there
                                        are any special orders or menu items that I need to be aware of. <br>

                                        As the day progresses, the diner starts to fill up with more and more customers.
                                        <br> It’s my job to take their orders, deliver their food, and make sure they
                                        have everything they need. This can be a bit hectic at times, especially when
                                        the diner is particularly busy, but I try my best to stay organized and keep
                                        track of all the orders coming in. <br>

                                        In between serving customers, I also have to keep an eye on the cleanliness of
                                        the dining room. <br>This includes wiping down tables, sweeping the floors, and
                                        restocking any supplies that are running low. It’s important to keep the diner
                                        looking clean and inviting, as it’s often the first impression that customers
                                        have of our establishment. <br>

                                        Finally, after a long and busy day, my shift ends at 2:00 pm. <br> It’s always a
                                        relief to clock out and head home, but at the same time, I always look forward
                                        to coming back the next day and serving our customers once again. Working at the
                                        diner may be tiring at times, but I like my job very much.
